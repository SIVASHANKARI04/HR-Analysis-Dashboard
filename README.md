# HR-HeadCount-Analysis-Dashboard


ðŸš€ Thrilled to share my first Power BI project!


This HR Headcount Analysis Dashboard is designed to provide key workforce insights at a glance:


ðŸ”¹ Total Employees: 972

ðŸ”¹ Gender Breakdown: 48.46% Male, 51.54% Female

ðŸ”¹ Headcount Trends: Growth over the years

ðŸ”¹ Insights by Business Unit, Country, and Age Group


ðŸ’¡ The goal is to empower HR teams with actionable data for better workforce planning and diversity strategies.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the data from your file:

**1. Chart Sheet**

Contains summarized data for different departments (e.g., Accounting, Engineering, Finance) with metrics like Annual Salary.

Includes cities (e.g., Austin, Beijing, Chengdu) with salary summaries.

It seems to be pre-aggregated data, potentially useful for quick visualizations.

**2. Employee Data Sheet**

Provides detailed employee-level data with fields like:

Employee ID, Full Name, Job Title, Department, Business Unit

**Demographics:** Gender, Ethnicity, Age

**Hire Details:** Hire Date

**Compensation:** Annual Salary, Bonus %

**Geography:** Country, City

Ideal for generating insights such as:

Headcount by Department/Location

Gender or Ethnicity diversity metrics

Salary and Bonus distribution
